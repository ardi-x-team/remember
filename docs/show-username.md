# Show that I'm logged in

When being logged in, there should be some place on the site where I can see with which account I am currently logged in. Username or name is probably sufficient.

## Acceptance tests

- When I am logged in, I see an area on the site where I can see my username. It will indicate that I am logged in with my own identity.
- Wherever I go and whatever I do, if I'm logged in I should always be able to see it.
