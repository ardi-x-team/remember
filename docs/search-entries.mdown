# Search entries

Search for entries and have the results presented to me.

## Acceptance tests

- There should be a search field where I can write what I want to search for.
- When hitting `Enter` the search should start.
- During search, an animated symbol should show to indicate that something is going on.
- The search results should be presented without a page refresh.
