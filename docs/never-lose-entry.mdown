# Never lose an entry

When I create a new entry, a draft version of that entry should be created
and continuously saved as draft during the time I write.

## Acceptance tests

- When I have written a few words in my entry and my computer dies, the entry should be recoverable when I restart and login to my account.
- When I accidentally close my browser window I want what was explained above to happen.
