# Continue writing entry

When I've closed an entry, I want to be able to easily continue writing on it later.

## Acceptance tests

- In seach results, there is a symbol/link that indicates that I can resume/proceed with/continue on this entry.
- When clicking that symbol/link, the entry is loaded up for me and I can continue writing on it.
- When I close the entry again, the new new version of the entry should be saved as an update (not a new entry).
